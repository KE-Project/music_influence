# Music Influence
Creation of an Ontology and a Knowledge Graph that models the influences between different artists for the Knowledge Engineering exam of A.Y. 2022-2023.

# Authors
* Francesco Alfieri
* Daniele Marini

# Usage 
In order query the Knowledge Graph we can use free and open source Java framework called Fuseki. 

The first thing to do is to clone the repository to have access to the data:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/KE-Project/music_influence.git
```

## Requirements

For running the query we first have to dowload fuseki, we can do that from [here](https://dlcdn.apache.org/jena/binaries/apache-jena-fuseki-4.8.0.zip).
After unzipping the file we can access the directory:

```shell
cd Users/Desktop/apache-jena-fuseki-4.8.0
```

and start the server by running

```shell
java -jar fuseki-server.jar
```

Now we can reach the server on port 3030:  http://localhost:3030/

## Import of the data

After opening fuseki the first thing we have to do is to create a dataset selecting the following steps:
* add one
    * choose a name
    * In-memory â€“ dataset
    * create dataset


Now we can select :
* add data
* select files (we will select the following files)
    * Protege_Ontology.ttl
    * All the files inside GPT results
    * All the files inside Knowledge_Graphs_sparqlanything
* upload all

# Query the Graph

At this point we can easly query the graph in the query section.
Here an example of query that returns the artists that collaborated with Louie_Bellson:


```shell
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
prefix mi: <http://www.semanticweb.org/KEProject/MusicalInfluences#>

SELECT ?artistName WHERE {  
	mi:Louie_Bellson mi:collaboratedWith ?artist.
    ?artist rdfs:label ?artistName.
}
```
